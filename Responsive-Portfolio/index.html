      <p>I am a 32 year old who lives in Inver Grove Heights. Somehow the combination of moving into a townhome and hanging out with the girlfriend everynight has caused me to drink 3-5 days a week. At least I am still hitting up the gym 4-5 days a week, otherwise I would be in trouble.</p>

      <p>Since leaving the Army after about 13 years of service, I am able to take this coding course. It helps to expand myself and learn more. </p>

      <p> Life has been pretty good for awhile. I have found a new love called vodka. For this last paragraph I am going to say a lot without saying anything. This can be achieved by continuosly writing about writing about nothing. That way I can finish this paragraph and not waste anymore time thinking about it, because I want to continue coding.
